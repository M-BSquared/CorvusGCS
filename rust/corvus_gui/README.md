# corvus_gui

The Corvus GCS desktop interface as a native Rust app (egui/eframe). It is
replacing the web interface in `src/`, page by page, and later becomes the
Android app as well.

It is a client of the backend's HTTP/SSE API, the same one the web interface
uses, so the backend does not change for it:

```bash
cargo run --release                                   # start serve.py here and show it
cargo run --release -- --server http://10.0.0.5:8080  # a backend elsewhere
cargo run --release -- --root DIR --python PATH       # where serve.py is, what runs it
```

Locally, `serve.py` runs as a child on a free port. Every way out (window
closed, SIGINT, SIGTERM) sends it SIGTERM, which runs its own teardown, and
SIGKILL if it is still there after 8 s. If the window does not close within
10 s of a signal, the child is killed and the process exits.

## What is here

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `src/backend.rs` | starts and stops `serve.py` |
| `src/http.rs` | a small HTTP/1.1 client, with a read timeout per read so a stream reader can stop |
| `src/sse.rs` | server-sent events |
| `src/telemetry.rs` | the `/api/telemetry` reader thread and the latest state |
| `src/units.rs` | display units from the config's `ui.units`, rounded the way the web interface rounds |
| `src/topbar.rs` | the status bar, word for word the web interface's (`src/js/topbar.js`) |
| `src/theme.rs` | colours from the default light theme |

The window title comes from `GET /api/version`; the crate carries no
version of its own.

## Toolchain

eframe 0.37 needs Rust 1.95 or newer. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.99 for
this folder only, so the default toolchain and `rust/corvus_link` are left
alone; rustup installs it on first use.

## Checks

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

Every rule a block of the bar follows has a test with the web interface's
expected text, including `toFixed` and `Math.round` rounding.
